# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information on various physicochemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level, which are used to predict wine quality scores.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning models for prediction.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb"
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, explore the dataset, and train models.

## Dataset
