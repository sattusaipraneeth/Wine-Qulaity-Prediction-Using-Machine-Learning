# Wine-Qulaity-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset contains information on various attributes like acidity, sugar levels, and alcohol content, which influence the wine's quality.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Red wine dataset
Each sample in the dataset is labeled with a quality score between 0 (low) and 10 (high), determined by wine tasters.
